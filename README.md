# Disaster_Tweets_Classification
The goal of this project is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can automatically classify tweets as disaster-related or non-disaster-related. This classification can be useful for emergency response teams, government agencies, and humanitarian organizations to filter relevant information quickly during natural disasters or crises.
